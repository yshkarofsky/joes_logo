	<p>It all started when Jo's sister got engaged, and she wanted a wedding monogram. Jo,
	having an artistic side, decided to draw a monogram with a pen and paper. Her sister was
	overjoyed when she saw this monogram. It was gorgeous. The only issue was that wanted the 
	monogram to be on her wedding invitation. Somehow, the monogram would not come out clear
	since it was created with a pen and paper, and not using a vector program on the computer.
	That pushed Jo to learn how to use vector programs. <br><br>
	Throughout her high school expirence, Jo wanted to take graphics classes when she got to college.
	One day, she was creating a monogram for a family friend. The monogram that Jo created was beautiful.
	When she showed it to them, the family friend did not like the monogram. She wanted it to be switched. 
	Jo understood that the customer has the final say in the design of a product, so she happily made the changes,
	although she hated the way the end product looked. The family friend was happy with the results. <br><br>
	This expirience taught Jo a few lessons, one of which was that no matter how good she ccould make it look, the customer
	has the right to change the whole design of it, and the final product will still have Jo's name on it. As a result
	of this observation, Jo decided that she does not want to get her degree in graphic design, but she wants to take
	a few classes to learn how to do it properly. Jo enjoys creating monogram and wants to utilize her talent so
	she creates monograms as a hobby.
